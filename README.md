### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**octlab/octlab** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

Hopefully, just started.
The initial goal is to have:

1. A bnf grammar for octave that's 100% compatible with MatLab core's syntax
2. A yacc based lexer and parser that generates OctLab AST
3. A cpp codegen class that generate llvm IR
4. An integrated backend Julia engine to speed up performance and do the symbolic calculation 
5. An integrated backend Scilab engine to do Simulink simulations
6. Other toolboxes equivalents.
